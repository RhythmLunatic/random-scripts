If you thought Touhou 6 remapping was hard, prepare yourself! th123 only uses dinput8 to check controller or keyboard!

Q: Why not use dinput8.dll replacement?
A: Doesn't work with Steam input remapping.

Controller check function is at DC60. NOPing it will crash the game.
After calling controller check function, eax is compared to 0, if not 0 then compare if ecx is less than -500, 
if less than 500 subtract from location of where the controller X Axis info is stored for the game, if greater than -500 then
add to it.
Y Axis data is also stored but th123 doesn't use it.
