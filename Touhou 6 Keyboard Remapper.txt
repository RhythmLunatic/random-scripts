Touhou 6: Emobdiment of Scarlet Devil key remapping (With a hex editor)

keyCheck function is in 0x1D820 / 41D820
GetKeyboardState is called at 0x1D851 / 41D851
lpKeyState is located at 0018FC66 but this gets overwritten later with some unrelated stuff
To remap keys, change what address offset is used!

How to remap the keys:
Take key you want from the table above, subtract 8 (in a hexidecimal calculator obviously) to get what to put in hex.
So the instruction for ESC key check is "8B 85 13 FF FF FF", to replace with END key take END (0x28) and subtract 8 to get 0x20. Put down 8B 85 20 FF FF FF, as you can see only the third byte is changed.

Not so simple way to find out what key it's checking (ignore this):
Ex. Z key func is checking AE. Z is 5A in the virtual key codes list. Let's say we want to check '1' at the top of the keyboard instead. 5A-31=29. Then ADD the result to where the key would be checking, so AE+29=D7. Now we have the function `mov eax,[ebp-000000D7]`. To get that in hex, do 100-D7 for 29, so the full function is 8B 85 29. Jump to the location of the asm func in a hex editor (tip: Ctrl+G jumps) and overwrite the existing value with the one you obtained in hex.

Subtract from E0 since we know E0 is down. For example, let's use [epb-AE]. E0 - AE is 32. Since down is key 0x28, add 32 to 0x28. This gets us key 0x5A, which is Z.

Dumb algebra way to remap the key (ignore this):
You might notice the epb offsets are reversed, because SHIFT (0x10) comes before CTRL (0x11) but you're subtracting one more for SHIFT.
EPB maximum is 108. This was calculated by doing a known key index and a known epb offset (10+F8=108)
108 - offset = keyboard button, so offset = -keyboard button+108
108-F8=10 (SHIFT)
And in reverse, -10+108=F8 (SHIFT in the complicated way the array is constructed)
So if we want to replace ESC with END (0x23), do -23+108 to get E5.

1D857: UP KEY     [epb-E2]
1D885: DOWN KEY   [epb-E0]
1D8B1: LEFT KEY   [epb-E3]
1D8DE: RIGHT KEY  [epb-E1]
1DAAF: Z KEY      [ebp-AE] | 8B 85 52 FF FF FF | Key 0x5A
1DADA: X KEY      [epb-B0]
1DB61: CTRL KEY   [epb-F7]
1DB07: SHIFT KEY  [epb-F8]
1DB35: ESC KEY    [epb-ED] | 8B 85 13 FF FF FF | Key 0x1B

Secondary controls: 
1D90F: Numpad 2 (down)      [epb-A0]
1D93B: Numpad 8 (up)        [epb-A6]
1D93B: Numpad 4 (left)      [epb-A4]
1D996: Numpad 6 (right)     [epb-A2]
1D9C4: Numpad 7 (upleft)    [epb-A1]
1D9F1: Numpad 3 (downright) [epb-9F]
1DA22: Numpad 1 (downleft)  [epb-A7]
1DA4E: Numpad 9 (upright)   [epb-A6-1]

Unused keys?
1DA7E: Home key???        [epb+E4] <--Yes, that's a plus. According to my disassembler.
1DB97: Q key (Unused?)    [epb-B7]
1DBC2: O key (Unused?)    [epb-B5]
1DBF0: IME Nonconvert key [epb-FB] <--Maybe secondary bomb key? I'm guessing this is something found on Japanese keyboards.
