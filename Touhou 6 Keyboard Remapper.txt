Touhou 6: Emobdiment of Scarlet Devil key remapping (With a hex editor)

keyCheck function is in 0x1D820 / 41D820
GetKeyboardState is called at 0x1D851 / 41D851
lpKeyState is located at 0018FC66 but this gets overwritten later with some unrelated stuff
To remap keys, change what address offset is used!

Ex. Z key func is checking AE. Z is 5A in the virtual key codes list. Let's say we want to check '1' at the top of the keyboard instead. 5A-31=29. Then ADD the result to where the key would be checking, so AE+29=D7. Now we have the function `mov eax,[ebp-000000D7]`. To get that in hex, do 100-D7 for 29, so the full function is 8B 85 29. Jump to the location of the asm func in a hex editor (tip: Ctrl+G jumps) and overwrite the existing value with the one you obtained in hex.

Simple way to find out what key it's checking:
Subtract from E0 since we know E0 is down. For example, let's use [epb-AE]. E0 - AE is 32. Since down is key 0x28, add 32 to 0x28. This gets us key 0x5A, which is Z.

1D857: UP KEY     [epb-E2]
1D885: DOWN KEY   [epb-E0]
1D8B1: LEFT KEY   [epb-E3]
1D8DE: RIGHT KEY  [epb-E1]
1DAAF: Z KEY      [ebp-AE]
1DADA: X KEY      [epb-B0]
1DB07: SHIFT KEY  [epb-F8]
1DB35: ESC KEY    [epb-ED]
1DB61: CTRL KEY   [epb-F7]

Secondary controls: 
1D90F: Numpad 2 (down)      [epb-A0]
1D93B: Numpad 8 (up)        [epb-A6]
1D93B: Numpad 4 (left)      [epb-A4]
1D996: Numpad 6 (right)     [epb-A2]
1D9C4: Numpad 7 (upleft)    [epb-A1]
1D9F1: Numpad 3 (downright) [epb-9F]
1DA22: Numpad 1 (downleft)  [epb-A7]
1DA4E: Numpad 9 (upright)   [epb-A6-1]

Unused keys?
1DA7E: Home key???        [epb+E4] <--Yes, that's a plus. According to my disassembler.
1DB97: Q key (Unused?)    [epb-B7]
1DBC2: O key (Unused?)    [epb-B5]
1DBF0: IME Nonconvert key [epb-FB] <--Maybe secondary bomb key? I'm guessing this is something found on Japanese keyboards.
